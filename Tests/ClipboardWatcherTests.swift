// Capture path (review 5A-04 / 5A-29).
//
// `ClipboardWatcher.capture(from:)` is the poll body, split out of
// `checkClipboard()` so it can be driven against a **private** pasteboard —
// the tests below never touch `NSPasteboard.general`, so running them cannot
// disturb the user's clipboard.
//
// What is pinned here:
//  - a text clip still lands in the store, classified, with its rich flavors;
//  - consecutive duplicates are still skipped (the dedupe contract survives
//    the move of the expensive half to a background queue);
//  - a very large clip no longer freezes the caller: capture of a 15 MB clip
//    returns in milliseconds instead of the measured 5.0 s.
